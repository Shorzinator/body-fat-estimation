### Usage of the app.R
- The app.R file does the final modeling and fires up the Shiny app just by executing the R script.

### The dataset
- The data that has been uploaded in the 'Final Files' folder is the preprocessed dataset. The preprocessing was done in Python and the script for that can also be found in the repository in the project_scripts/preprocessing/preprocessing.py (or this [link](https://github.com/Shorzinator/body_fat_estimation/blob/main/project_scripts/preprocessing/preprocessing.py)).

### The plots
- All the plots that were generated during the EDA can be reproduced using the script in project_scripts/EDA/EDA.py (or the [link](https://github.com/Shorzinator/body_fat_estimation/blob/main/project_scripts/EDA/EDA.py)).

### Output of plots
- These can be found in the results/EDA, results/post_processing, and results/modeling folders. The link to the results folder is [here](https://github.com/Shorzinator/body_fat_estimation/tree/main/results).
